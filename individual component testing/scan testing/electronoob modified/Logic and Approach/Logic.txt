Brief Overview
The scanning routine proceeds in three main stages—initialization, layered scanning for each sensor, and return-to-home—using a shared Z-axis lift and individual steppers for rotation. Each sensor (IR, Ultrasonic 1, Ultrasonic 2) takes a full 360° sweep at a given height, then the assembly lifts up one layer and repeats until no object remains in view. Finally, the Z-axis returns to its starting position.

1. Initialization Phase
Lift Z-axis up by 10 cm at high speed.

Lower Z-axis back down 10 cm at high speed.

Spin the turntable one full revolution at high speed.

This “warm-up” ensures all motors are moving freely and returns them all to known home positions before actual scanning begins.

2. Layered Scanning Phase
For each of the three sensors in sequence—IR, Ultrasonic 1, Ultrasonic 2—the code runs the same scanLayer() routine:

Open or create the corresponding file (SC00I.txt, SC00U1.txt, or SC00U2.txt) and write a header if it’s the first layer.

Rotate the sensor’s stepper one step at a time for thetaCounts steps (one full 360°).

At each step:

Read distance from the sensor (median-filtered IR or ultrasonic ping).

Compute (x,y) using polar-to-Cartesian:

𝑥
=
𝑑
sin
⁡
(
𝜃
)
,
𝑦
=
𝑑
cos
⁡
(
𝜃
)
x=dsin(θ),y=dcos(θ)
Compute z as layerCount × zLayerSpacing.

Append the (x, y, z) point to the file.

Track whether any reading is below maxDist − tolerance (i.e., an object is detected).

After the full rotation:

If any reading saw an object, lift the Z-axis by one layer (noZSteps) and increment layerCount, then repeat the rotation at the new height.

If all readings were at max distance, stop scanning that sensor.

3. Return-to-Home Phase
After completing IR, Ultrasonic 1, and Ultrasonic 2 scans:

Reverse Z-axis direction.

Step down layerCount × noZSteps steps to return to the original base position.

Halt further motion with an infinite loop.

This structure ensures each sensor performs a full 3D sweep of the object, layer by layer, and writes its own point-cloud file before moving on to the next sensor.
