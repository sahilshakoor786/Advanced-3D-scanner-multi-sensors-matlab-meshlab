Your scanner integrates five core mathematical components:

Triangulation-based IR ranging, where the Sharp GP2Y0A51SK0F outputs a voltage proportional to object distance via an internal triangulation method

IR Sensor Triangulation
The Sharp GP2Y0A51SK0F employs an IR-LED, a position-sensitive detector (PSD), and onboard signal processing to perform triangulation: as the reflected spot moves on the PSD, the output voltage varies nonlinearly with distance

A cubic calibration curve (as in your code) maps output voltage to distance, capping at the sensor’s maximum (~15 cm) for stability

Ultrasonic Sonar Ranging

Stepper Motor Motion Control
Angular Resolution
Standard steppers have a full-step angle (commonly 1.8° per step for 200 steps/rev). Microstepping divides this further—for example, 1/256 microsteps yields ≈ 0.007° per microstep (i.e., 51,200 microsteps/rev)

Speed vs. Precision
Your code uses two pulse routines:

rotateMotor() with 1 ms pulses (~500 Hz) for scanning, balancing speed and stability.

rotateMotorFast() with 0.2 ms pulses (~2,500 Hz) for initialization moves.
Angular displacement per pulse remains the same; only the stepping frequency changes

Layer-by-Layer Scanning Rationale
Slicing an object into horizontal layers is akin to rapid prototyping and tomography: each 2D contour (point cloud slice) captures object cross-sections at known z heights 
ResearchGate
.
By projecting sensor readings onto successive planes—lifting Δz per pass—you build up a full 3D model without complex surface fitting, directly stitching together contours from each layer 
ResearchGate
.

Through these mathematical and rational foundations—sensor calibration, geometric conversion, precise motor control, and systematic layering—your scanner reliably acquires a 3D point cloud of the scanned object.
